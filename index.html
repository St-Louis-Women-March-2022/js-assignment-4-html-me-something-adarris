      <h2>a hopeful start</h2>
         <p>At the end of a rough 2020, my partner (Jae), my dog (Navi), my cat (Peach), and I moved to our new place. 
         Still in Dutchtown, it was a mostly painless move.
         We brought a few gardening tools from our old place, and I made a graph for what our new, south-facing garden could look like.
         </p>
         <p>Here are the key points:
            <ol>
            <li>Key veggies: tomato, spinach, bell peppers, spicy peppers</li>
            <li>Flowers to help veggies: peonies, sunflowers, roses, and local mixes</li>
            <li>Space for experimental veggies and herbs</li>
            <li>Clearly marked beds with nice edge so our pup isn't running through the vegetables</li>
            <li>Not spending too much money &#162;&#162;&#162;</li>
            </ol>

         <p>A great plan, indeed. Though some major flaws included: <b>I have no idea how to start, and I don't have the energy for this.</b> 
         This left us with gorgeous tomato plants, thriving mint, a dying peach tree, lots of under-grown peppers, healthy sage plant, and somehow a few marijuana plants. 
         The main thing we had in this garden though was A LOT OF WEED. I swear I almost lost my love because it was such an eye sore for them. 
         They were ready to give up the garden project for the next year :'(
         </p>
      <h2>getting by with the help of my friends</h2>
         <p>This lead us into fall 2021 with way too much mint, tomato, and <b>WEEDS!</b>
            Then, life happened to me... my sister died in September 2021 (big kisses for you lil sis) and everything fell a part.
            I was staying with my mom for a long while.
            Depressing shit for a later post... I came back home 2 months later to an enitrely different house :').
            My friends laid out weed killer, brought mulch, cleaned up the overgrown beds, weeded the walkway, added brick, and even built a fire place.
            They went as far as to bring in a lovely outdoor seating set, those cute ass lights hanging on the porch, and a rug!
            Good friends yo.. they really got our garden right! spring 2022 will be easy... at least easier.
         </p>
      <h2>trying to get it back</h2>
         <p>TBH it was so much easier.
            With a tiny bit of energy for starting seeds and going to garden shops, we somehow got some tomato, pepper, new flowers... a still alive peach tree too.
            They really helped us out. 
            <p>Sometimes I'd get inspired and watch youtubes about garden styles.
               This one on Cottage-style gardens was dope. 
               I was insipired by the messy, throw seeds around kind of carefully, cozy feel.

         <p> Life really comes at you fast. I guess my garden is a mess because I'm a mess. 
            and life is a mess. 
            and my garden is absolutely <b>full of life</b>.</p>
